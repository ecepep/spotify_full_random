"""
Intend to provide an [almost] random sub-sample of all spotify's songs (to make a small random playlist) 

simple strategy: The "mr good enough" strategy, just search with random title (2 latin-letters) Âµor year and random genre, so that it feels random
@todo add other alphabets

Observation:
- If genre criteria is there, title must be exact (full) ==> rather select with years
- The api do not like partial search
- I need dictionnaries
Conclusion:
- This will never be random though it is fun to have spotify own selection for each genre
- Use another database for random selection -> spotify search is too biased...
- @todo take a look at spotify recommandation
